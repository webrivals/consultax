                <p class="section-para">
                    We offer a diverse array of professional services, many of which necessitate the processing of personal data to deliver tailored advice and solutions. The lawful basis for processing such data varies depending on the specific context. Our processing activities are grounded in one or more of the following legal justifications:
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <span class="fw-semibold txt-theme-primary">Performance of a Contract:</span> Processing is essential to fulfill the terms of a contract or to take preparatory steps prior to entering into a contractual agreement with our clients.
                    <br>
                    <span class="fw-semibold txt-theme-primary">Legitimate Interests:</span> Processing is conducted to advance our legitimate business interests, provided these interests are not overridden by individuals’ rights and freedoms.

                    <br>
                    For instance, in fulfilling customer due diligence requirements under anti-money laundering regulations, we perform searches to identify politically exposed persons (PEPs), high-risk individuals, and organisations. These measures include verifying the absence of factors that could preclude us from engaging with a client, such as sanctions, criminal convictions (including those of company directors and beneficial owners), conduct concerns, or other reputational risks.
                    <br>
                    Even where no explicit legal obligation exists, we process personal data based on our legitimate interest in fulfilling regulatory requirements and safeguarding the integrity of our operations.
