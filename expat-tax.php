                                            If you are a UK expat with UK-based income or gains, or if you meet specific residency criteria, you
                                            may still need to file a UK tax return. Our team can assess your individual circumstances to ensure
                                            compliance and identify any potential tax-saving opportunities.

                                            Double Taxation Agreements (DTAs) between the UK and other countries can help prevent being
                                            taxed twice on the same income. Our experts can guide you on how to use these treaties to reduce
                                            your overall tax burden.

                                            Returning to the UK may trigger “temporary non-resident” rules, potentially impacting income and
                                            gains realized during your absence. We can help you navigate these rules to avoid unexpected tax
                                            liabilities on your return.
